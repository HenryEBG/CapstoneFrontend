# RefugeeConnect

It is a plataform that let all refugees of KRM a non profit organization, is indicated to providing resettlement services to refugees.  As a part of this comunity I saw that it very dificult for the new people that arrive to be connect with other refugees and with places where they can join with other or they can get some services or food.

The project will include an administration of the users, the places and services.

Administrators can create new users and all users can add places like markets, chuchs, food banks, entertainments etc.

At the same time they can aproach with other refugees but always with the security of not share relevant information of their cases.
